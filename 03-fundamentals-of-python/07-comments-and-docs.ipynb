You might have some task you want to do many times over several projects over the next few years, in which case the user may be future-you. Will you remember in two weeks' time what parameters your function takes? How about in two months? Two years? If you make your code available to others to use, they will also want to know how to use your functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of figuring out how to use a function is to simply look at the code, but this isn't ideal. It means finding the particular file where the function is written and looking through the whole function to see what all the variables do, which is time-consuming and can be difficult in large or complex functions. A much better solution is documentation - writing down what your code does as you write it.\n",

These are useful and an important aspect of documentation.

To do this we'll use two things: comments, which we've already seen, and **docstrings**.\n",

This may also seem like an easy mistake to spot and to ignore, but again, the best case scenario here is that you realise the comment is wrong, in which case the comment may as well not be there. Also, what if the comment isn't wrong? Maybe we changed the comment and then neglected to change the code. However it happens, if the code and comment don't match up, would you be able to determine which one is correct?

The description of the function call may seem redundant, but we'll see in a moment how it can be made more useful. Also note here that we're documenting the function itself here, not the code within it. Smaller blocks of code certainly should be commented, especially in a larger function than this, but it's very easy to fall into the traps described above, and it's more important to comment chunks of code than individual lines.

Choosing meaningful variable names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical “chunks” are helpful techniques for producing _readable code_. This is useful not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original programmer.
